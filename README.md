# Full Stack Banking Application

<h3 align="center">Full Stack Banking Application </h3>

</p>





## Description 
In the Bad Bank project, we were tasked with creating an insecure banking application that *might* take your information (and money). This project is a culmination of 32 weeks of work and is a capstone full-stack banking application. 

### The Technology Used in the Creation of the Application 

* Boostrap 
* Firebase
* React
* MongoDB
* Bootstrap
* NodeJS
* Express


## Features

This app features the full MERN stack of technologies. Thus it features a node.js server that sends data to a MongoDB server. It also includes API itegration that connects the front end to the back end. 

This allows for the creation of a user using the username and password. It also includes Google authentication as a secondary method of authentication. Once an account is created, the user recieves a prompt telling them the account has been created successfully. Once the user has loged in, they can deposit, and withdraw and check their balance. If the user logs out and logs back in, the session is saved with the balance saved. There is also an Alldata page that will show all the users and their balances. In the future, I plan on adding money tranfer between users, and a profile picture. Then, I will allow the user deposit a check using a picture. 

## Installation Guideline

1. Clone the repo where the app is hosted

   ```
4. You will be directed to http://localhost:3000/ to run the application.
