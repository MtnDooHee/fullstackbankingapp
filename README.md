# Full Stack Banking Application

<h3 align="center">Full Stack Banking Application </h3>

</p>





## Description 
In the Bad Bank project, we were tasked with creating an insecure banking application that *might* take your information (and money). This project is a culmination of 32 weeks of work and is a capstone full-stack banking application. 

### The Technology Used in the Creation of the Application 

* Boostrap 
* Firebase
* React
* MongoDB
* Bootstrap
* NodeJS
* Express


## Features

As the project name implies, this capstone project utilizes the full suite of MERN technologies. There are these layers to this project:
1. A node.js server that sends data to a MongoDB server
2. API integration that allows a connection between the front and back end\

What these layers do is allow for a user to create their own account on this app using their username and password. After account creation, the users are given a confirmation prompt that their account has been created to improve the user experience. After a user has successfuly created their account, they are then able to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. 

Future potential features that I would like to add are:
- User profile updates that are persistent
- Check deposite by taking a picture of the check
- Assignment of random account numbers to new accounts
- Money transfer between users
- Account types (checking/savings)
- Roles


## Installation Guideline

This app can be found at 

1. Clone the repo where the app is hosted
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MtnDooHee/fullstackbankingapp/
   ```
2. Running npm install from inside the app directory (where package.json is located) will install all the dependencies for this app
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the Node server
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
4. You will be directed to http://localhost:3000/ to run the application.
